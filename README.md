1.Create a directory named git-basic-exercises

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ mkdir git-basic-exercises
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ ls
 cd             git-basic-exercises    recruits.md
 CHANGELOG.md  'GIT Basics Exercise'   simo
 cohort.md      Music                  Templates
 Cohort.md      my_files               Umuzi.md
 Desktop        mymy_bio.md            Videos
 Documents      Pictures               workspace
 Downloads      Public                 workspase
 exersice.md    README.md

2.cd into your new directory

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ cd git-basic-exercises
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/git-basic-exercises$ 

3.look at whatâ€™s inside using ls -a. It should be empty

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/git-basic-exercises$ ls -a
.  ..

4.initialize your git repo using git init. Then check ls -a again. Can you spot the difference?

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/git-basic-exercises$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/recruit/git-basic-exercises/.git/
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/git-basic-exercises$ ls -a
.  ..  .git

* yes I see the difference of .  ..  .git.


5.check the status of your repo by typing git status

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/git-basic-exercises$ git statusOn branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

6.type in touch README.md. This creates a new blank file. Then check ls -a and git status again.

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ touch README.md
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ ls
 cd             Documents              Music         README.md     Videos

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

7.type in git log. The output should make sense to you

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ git log
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

8.Now add your readme file to your git staging area. Hint: use the git add command

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ git add
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

9.Then check your git status again. Can you see the difference?

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

10.Try to unstage your file and check your git status again


11.Ok, now for your first commit: Make sure your readme file is staged then type in git commit -m "initial commit" Your output should be something like this: [master (root-commit) 2103b64] initial commit 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-) create mode 100644 README.m

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/git-basic-exercises$ echo "# git-basic-exercises" >> README.md
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/git-basic-exercises$ git init
